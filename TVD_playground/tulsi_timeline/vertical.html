        <p style=" font-weight:100; font-family: freight-text-pro, serif;">This war of deception and hatred against my mom is being waged by <span style="color:#55DDE0; font-weight:500;">homosexual</span> activists because they know, that if elected, she will not allow them to force their values down the throats of the children in our schools.</p>

        <p>Working with my father, Mike Gabbard, and others to pass a constitutional amendment to protect <span style="color:#55DDE0; font-weight:500;">traditional marriage</span>, I learned that real leaders are willing to make personal sacrifices for the common good. I will bring that attitude of public service to the legislature.</p>

          <p>To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and <span style="color:#55DDE0; font-weight:500;">same-sex marriage</span> is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii...As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of <span style="color:#55DDE0; font-weight:500;">homosexual extremists</span>.</p>

          <p>Some of these experiences living and working in oppressive countries...It really caused me to take a look at myself and the way we’re doing things here at home, locally, and nationally...<span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">Marriage</span> is a bond of love, and it’s spiritual and metaphysical in nature...It’s a sacred bond, and that is not an area where government should be involved.</p>

So it was a process that I went through that changed my views in many ways and in many big ways to the views that I hold today.</p>

          <p>When we deny <span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">LGBTQ</span> people the basic rights that exist for every American, we are denying their humanity — denying that they are equal. We are also creating a dangerous environment that breeds discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>First, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I'm grateful for those in the <span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">LGBTQ+</span> community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey...Over the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on <span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">LGBTQ+</span> issues, such as the Equality Act, the repeal of DOMA, Restore Honor to Service members Act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Equality for All Resolution. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for <span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">LGBTQ+</span> Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all....</p>

My views have changed significantly since then...and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart: a strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for <span style="color:#F26419;font-weight:500;">L.G.B.T.Q.</span> rights.</p>
