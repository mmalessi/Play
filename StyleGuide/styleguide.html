                <br>
                  <b>Empower.  </b>Help people understand what the rules of safety are and how to execute them.
                <br><br>
                  <b>Respect.  </b>Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. 
                <br><br>
                  <b>Educate.  </b>We don’t dump information to be interpreted. We interpret the complexities for them and give them only what they need to know. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything you know.
                <br><br>
                  <b>Guide.  </b>Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers. Whether you’re leading them tasks, laws, or procedures, communicate in a friendly and helpful way. We’re not here to tell people about stuff. We are here to help people get things done. 
                <br><br><br>

                <br><br>
                  <b>Useful.  </b>Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
                <br><br>
                  <b>Friendly.  </b>Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. Creating a safety culture is about connecting, not directing.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Voice and Tone</h2>
            <div class="resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
                <p>What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.
                <br><br>Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.
                <br><br>The same is true for EH&amp;S. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Voice</h3>
            <p>EH&amp;S’s voice is human. It’s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. Our priority is explaining how to execute things safely and helping our community get their work done so they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.
            <br><br>One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. EH&S’s voice is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Steady but not grave</li>
                <li>Confident but not cocky</li>
                <li>Smart but not stodgy</li>
                <li>Approachable but not sloppy</li>
                <li>Helpful but not overbearing</li>
                <li>Expert but not bossy</li>
                <li>Engaging but not loud</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Tone</h3>
            <p>When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with the school year? Are they confused and seeking our help on through an email? Are they curious about new feature on our website? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.
            <br><br>
            Safety is a serious affair, but we are never here to scare people straight. When encouraging a reader to perform a certain safety task, you’re not guiding them with a stick--"you better or else"--or a carrot--"if you do this we’ll give you a sticker". Instead we are the guardian angels, swooping in to make all the complicated and difficult safety rules much easier to follow and understand. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Style Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Active Voice.  </b>Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.</li>
                <li><b>Avoid Slang and Jargon.  </b>Write in plain English.</li>
                <li><b>Write Positively.  </b>Use positive language rather than negative language.</li>
            </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Spicey Scale</h3>
        <p>The text below is taken from the site and edited for tone. Mild tone is good for very serious topics. Medium might be fun for something non-life threatening but still important, like ergonomics. Hot might not be used very often in the EH&S voice, but it might have a place in news or other announcements.</p>
        <div class="subheading">Mild</div>
            <p>Ergonomics is the study of the relationship between people, their work, and their physical work environment. The purpose of Stanford University’s Ergonomics Program is to promote employee health by limiting ergonomic risk factors. This section presents best practices for workplace ergonomics.</p>
        <div class="subheading">Medium</div>
            <p>Making sure you have a healthy relationship with your physical work environment is our prerogative. If you want to learn more about limiting risk factors--whether it be a comfortable chair or split keyboard--this section presents best practices for workplace ergonomics.

            <p>We hate carpal tunnel, too. As ergonomists, we’re experts on the topic of how your work environment impacts your health. Here we tell you all about best practices!</p>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-5">Writing About People</h2>
            <p>We write the same way do our jobs: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Stanford a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Age</h3>
            <p>Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it is relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.</p>
            <br>
          <blockquote>The CEO, 16, just got her driver’s license.
          </blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly.”
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Disability</h3>
            <p>Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: ”she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.”
                <br><br>When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.” “Handicapped parking” is okay.
            </p>
        <h3>Gender and Sexuality</h3>
        <p>Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.” Use “folks,” or “people,” or “humans,” or “professors,” or “students.” Etc. Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.” It’s OKAY to use “they” as a singular pronoun.
            <br><br>Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:
        </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Lesbian</li>
            <li>Gay</li>
             <li>Bisexaul</li>
             <li>Transgender (never "transgendered")</li>
             <li>Trans</li>
             <li>Queer</li>
             <li>LGBTQI</li>
         </ul>
        <p>Don't use these words in reference to LGBTQI people or communities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homosexual</li>
            <li>Lifestyle</li>
            <li>Preference</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
          <p>Don’t use “same-sex” marriage, unless the distinction is relevant to what you’re writing. (Avoid “gay marriage.”) Otherwise, it’s just “marriage.” <br><br>
              When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.
          </p>
          <h3>Hearing</h3>
          <p>Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”</p>
          <h3>Heritage and Nationality</h3>
          <p>Don't use hyphens when referring to someone with dual heritage or nationality. For example, use "Asian American" instead of "Asian-American."</p>
          <h3>Medical Conditions</h3>
          <p>Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.
              <br><br>If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”
          </p>
          <h3>Mental and Cognitive Conditions</h3>
          <p>Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.
              <br><br>Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.
          </p>
          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.</p>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-5">Grammar</h2>
            <h3>Basics</h3>
            <p><b>Write for all readers. </b>Some people will read every word you write. Others will just skim. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.</p>
    
            <p><b>Focus your message.</b> Create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content, in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and pages.</p>
          
            <p><b>Be concise. </b>Use short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.</p>
        
            <p><b>Be specific. A</b>void vague language. Cut the fluff.</p>
         
            <p><b>Be consistent. </b>Stick to the patterns and style points outlined in this guide.</p>
          <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <h5>Abbreviations and Acronyms</h5>
            <p>If there’s a chance your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it. Then use the short version for all other references. If the abbreviation isn’t clearly related to the full version, specify in parentheses.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>First use: Network Operations Center
                </li>
                <li>Second use: NOC</li>
                <li>First use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</li>
                <li>Second use: UTC</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like API or HTML, use it instead (and don’t worry about spelling it out).</p>
        <h5>Active Voice</h5>
            <p>Use active voice. Avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Yes: Marti logged into the account.</li>
                <li>No: The account was logged into by Marti.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.One exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000"><li>Your account was flagged by our IT team.</li></ul>
        <h5>Capitalization</h5>
            <p>We use a few different forms of capitalization. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word.
                <br><br>When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>freddie@stanford.edu</li>
                <li>stanford.edu</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't capitalize random words in the middle of sentences. Here are some words that we never capitalize in a sentence. For more, see the Word List.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>website</li>
                <li>internet</li>
                <li>online</li>
                <li>email</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Contractions</h5>
            <p>They’re great! They give your writing an informal, friendly tone. In most cases, use them as you see fit. </p>
            <h5>Emojis</h5>
            <p>Emoji are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use them infrequently and deliberately.</p>
            <h5>Numbers</h5>
            <p>Spell out a number when it begins a sentence. Otherwise, use the numeral. This includes ordinals, too.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Ten new employees started on Monday, and 12 start next week.</li>
                <li>I ate 3 donuts at Coffee Hour.</li>
                <li>Meg won 1st place in last year’s Walktober contest.</li>
                <li>We hosted a group of 8th graders who are learning to code.</li>
                <li>Twenty-one years ago, I started working at Stanford.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(Sometimes it feels weird to use "1" instead of "one." Just go with your gut.)</p>
            <p>Numbers over 3 digits get commas:</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>999</li>
                <li>1,000</li>
                <li>150,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Write out big numbers in full. Abbreviate them if there are space restraints, as in a tweet or a chart: 1k, 150k.</p>
            <h5>Dates</h5>
            <p>Generally, spell out the day of the week and the month. Abbreviate only if space is an issue in the app.</p>

                <li>Saturday, January 24</li>

            </ul>

            </p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>$20</li>
                <li>$19.99</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When writing about other currencies, follow the same symbol-amount format:</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>¥1</li>
                <li>€1</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Telephone Numbers</h5>
            <p>Use dashes without spaces between numbers. Use a country code if your reader is in another country.</p>

                <li>555-867-5309</li>
                <li>+1-404-123-4567</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Temperature</h5>
            <p>Use the degree symbol and the capital F abbreviation for Fahrenheit or capital C for Celsius.</p>
             <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>98°F</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Time</h5>
            <p>Use numerals and am or pm, with a space in between. Don’t use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>7 am</li>
                <li>7:30 pm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>7am-10:30pm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Abbreviate time zones within the continental United States as follows:</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Eastern time: ET</li>
                <li>Central time: CT</li>
                <li>Mountain time: MT</li>
                <li>Pacific time: PT</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When referring to international time zones, spell them out: Nepal Standard Time, Australian Eastern Time. If a time zone does not have a set name, use its Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset.</p>
            <p>Abbreviate decades when referring to those within the past 100 years (prior to 2000. If referring to the decade between 2000-2010, refer to it as the 2000s).</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>the 80s</li>
                <li>the 90s</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When referring to decades more than 100 years ago, be more specific:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>the 1900s</li>
                <li>the 1800s</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Punctuation</h3>
            <h5>Apostrophes</h5>
            <p>The apostrophe’s most common use is making a word possessive. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an ‘s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>The donut thief ate Sam’s donut.</li>
                <li>The donut thief ate Chris’s donut.</li>
                <li>The donut thief ate the managers’ donuts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Apostrophes can also be used to denote that you’ve dropped some letters from a word, usually for humor or emphasis. This is fine, but do it sparingly.</p>
            <h5>Colons</h5>
            <p>Use a colon (rather than an ellipsis, em dash, or comma) to offset a list.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Erin ordered 3 kinds of donuts: glazed, chocolate, and pumpkin.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also use a colon to join 2 related phrases. If a complete sentence follows the colon, capitalize the 1st word.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>I was faced with a dilemma: I wanted a donut, but I’d just eaten a bagel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Commas</h5>
            <p>Advice: read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.</p>
            <h5>Oxford Comma</h5>
            <p>The Oxford Comma is the comma that goes before the and at the end of a list. Always use the the Oxford Comma.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>With the Oxford Comma: We invited humanitarian diplomats, JFK, and Stalin.</li>
                <li>Without it: We invited humanitarian diplomats, JFK and Stalin. (Um? The humanitarian diplomats are JFK and Stalin?)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Dashes and Hyphens</h5>
            <p>Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>first-time user</li>
                <li>Monday-Firday</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use an em dash (—) without spaces on either side to offset an aside.Use a true em dash, not hyphens (-).</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Multivariate testing—just one of our new Pro features—can help you grow your business.</li>
                <li>Austin thought Brad was the donut thief, but he was wrong—it was Lain.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Ellipses</h5>
            <p>Ellipses (...) can be used to indicate that you’re trailing off before the end of a thought. Use them sparingly. Don’t use them for emphasis or drama, and don’t use them in titles or headers.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>“Where did all those donuts go?” Christy asked. Lain said, “I don't know...”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ellipses, in brackets, can also be used to show that you're omitting words in a quote.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>“When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, [...] a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.”</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Periods</h5>
            <p>Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Christy said, “I ate a donut.”</li>
                <li>I ate a donut (and I ate a bagel, too).</li>
                <li>I ate a donut and a bagel. (The donut was Sam’s.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leave a single space between sentences.</p>
            <h5>Question Marks</h5>
            <p>Question marks go inside quotation marks if they’re part of the quote. Like periods, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.</p>
            <h5>Exclamation Points</h5>
            <p>Use exclamation points sparingly, and never more than one at a time. They’re like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying.
                <br><br>
                Exclamation points go inside quotation marks. Like periods and question marks, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.
                <br><br>
                Never use exclamation points in failure messages or alerts. When in doubt, avoid!
            </p>
            <h5>Quotation Marks</h5>
            <p>Use quotes to refer to words and letters, titles of short works (like articles and poems), and direct quotations.
                <br><br>Periods and commas go within quotation marks. Question marks within quotes follow logic—if the question mark is part of the quotation, it goes within. If you’re asking a question that ends with a quote, it goes outside the quote.
                <br><br>Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Who was it that said, “A fool and his donut are easily parted”?</li>
                <li>Brad said, “A wise man once told me, ‘A fool and his donut are easily parted.’”</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Semicolons</h5>
            <p>Go easy on semicolons. They usually support long, complicated sentences that could easily be simplified. Try an em dash (—) instead, or simply start a new sentence.
            </p>
            <h5>Ampersands</h5>
            <p>Don't use ampersands unless one is part of a company or brand name.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Ben and Dan</li>
                <li>Ben & Jerry’s</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>People, Places, and Things</h5>
            <div class="subheading">File Extensions</div>
            <p>When referring generally to a file extension type, use all uppercase without a period. Add a lowercase s to make plural.</p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>GIF</li>
                <li>PDF</li>

                <li>JPGs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When referring to a specific file, the filename should be lowercase:</p>

                <li>slowclap.gif</li>
                <li>MCBenefits.pdf</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="subheading">Pronouns</div>
            <p>If your subject’s gender is unknown or irrelevant, use “they,” “them,” and “their” as a singular pronoun. Use “he/him/his” and “she/her/her” pronouns only when the person you are talking about has explicitly written or told you what their preferred pronouns are. Don’t use “one” as a pronoun.

            <p>The first time you mention a person in writing, refer to them by their first and last names. On all other mentions, refer to them by their first name. (Sometimes this may feel inappropriate. Listen to your gut and use the last name where you feel it’s best.)
                <br><br>Capitalize the names of departments and teams (but not the word "team" or "department").
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #820000">
                <li>Marketing team</li>

                <br>Refer to EH&amp;S as “we,” not “it.”
